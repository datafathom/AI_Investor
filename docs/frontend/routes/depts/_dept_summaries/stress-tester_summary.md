# Department 🏛️: The Stress-Tester

**Focus**: Chaos simulation and robustness testing
**Quadrant**: META (This is like the 'Meta' section of the spaceship)

## What does this department do? (High School Level)
Imagine this department is the the stress-tester room in our OS. It handles everything related to chaos simulation and robustness testing.
Every sub-page here is a specialized 'tool' or 'station' for a specific job.

## 🛠️ Detailed Sub-Page Breakdown

### 📍 War Game Simulator (`/stress-tester/wargame`)
**Core Purpose**: Extreme black swan simulations and cascade analysis.

**Detailed Functionality:**
- **What it is**: A specialized screen within The Stress-Tester designed for war game simulator.
- **Planned Logic**: This page will eventually connect to real-time streams to show data about extreme black swan simulations and cascade analysis..
- **User Experience**: Built with a 'Heavy/Industrial' OS look for professional monitoring.
