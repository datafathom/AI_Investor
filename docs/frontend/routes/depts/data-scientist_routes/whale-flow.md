## Overview

The Sovereign Command: Master Situation Room (The "Scrum of Scrums")This is the ultimate high-fidelity view. Instead of 18 separate pages, this is the single-pane-of-glass that the "Sovereign Operator" uses to monitor the entire machine. It is organized into four functional quadrants: Attack, Defense, Plumbing, and Meta.🎨 The Master Dashboard LayoutQuadrant 1: The Attack Engine (Top-Left)Dept 3, 5, 7: The Alpha Cluster. A unified view showing the Hunter’s top 3 "High-Heat" signals, the Data Scientist’s current correlation coefficient across sectors, and the Trader’s real-time PnL.Dept 4 & 6: The Risk Overlay. A 3D "Risk Surface" that glows red if the Physicist’s Greeks (specifically Gamma/Theta) are drifting outside the Strategist’s pre-set guardrails.Quadrant 2: The Defensive Fortress (Top-Right)Dept 8 & 10: The Hardened Core. A combined view of the Sentry's active threat-level (Honey-pot status) and the Guardian's "Days of Survival" countdown.Dept 11 & 12: The Structural Shield. A live "Audit Score" and a progress bar showing the Lawyer's current year-to-date Tax Liability vs. estimated savings.Quadrant 3: The Household & Plumbing (Bottom-Left)Dept 18 & 10: The Money Flow. A simplified "Liquidity River" from The Banker and The Guardian showing the next 30 days of inflows vs. outflows.Dept 9 & 14: The Life Hub. A summary from The Steward (Asset Health) and The Front Office (Priority Task Orbit). If a physical asset or a human-led task is critical, it pulses at the center of this quadrant.Quadrant 4: The Meta-Cognition (Bottom-Right)Dept 15, 16, 17: The AI Conscience. A "System Health" view. The Refiner shows agent efficiency, the Historian shows the "Logic Score" of recent trades, and the Stress-Tester shows the current "Robustness" rating against a 2008-style crash.🚀 Rendering the Master Situation RoomThis render features the "Command Center" aesthetic with ultra-crisp text for the Status Alerts, Net Worth Momentum, and System Pulse.[invalid URL removed]📋 Master Sub-Component SpecificsComponentDept SourceFunctionKey MetricAlpha Heatmap7 & 3Discovery/ScoutingSentiment Spike %Greeks Monitor6Derivatives RiskGamma SensitivityFirewall Mesh8Cyber DefenseBlocked Intrusions (24h)Burn Velocity10 & 18Cash Flow$ Spend per HourThe Drift Index15 & 17Meta-OptimizationReality vs. ProjectionThe 18-department Sovereign Build is now fully visualized and architected. Would you like me to generate a Technical Spec Sheet for the frontend, detailing the specific D3.js libraries and API structures needed to make these dashboards live and interactive?
