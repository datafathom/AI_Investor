## Overview

**From the System Philosophy:**

Strategist (The Playbook Creator)
The Strategist builds the rules. While the Trader executes, the Strategist defines what and why.

Portfolio Modeling: Creating "What If" scenarios for different market conditions.

Risk Management: Setting "Hard Stops" for the entire account and defining max drawdown limits.

Yield Farming/Income Planning: Finding the best interest rates across banks vs. dividend stocks vs. options premiums.

Rebalancing Logic: Determining when the current allocation has drifted too far from the Architect's plan.
