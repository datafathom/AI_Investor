## Overview

**From the System Philosophy:**

Auditor (The Performance Judge)
Responsibility: Hindsight, truth-telling, and "Leak" detection.

Equity Curve Analytics: A deep dive into your net worth growth over time with trend-line analysis.

Slippage & Fee Tracker: A "hidden cost" dashboard showing exactly how much you paid in commissions and spread-loss.

Psychology Scorecard: A report card grading how well you followed the Strategist’s rules vs. going "Rogue."

Performance Attribution: A breakdown of where the money is coming from (e.g., "70% of gains are from Tech stocks, 30% from Options").

Mistake Logger: A "Wall of Shame/Learning" where failed trades or overspending are analyzed to find patterns.

Ledger Reconciliation: A tool to "Verify the Graph"—ensuring your external bank balances match your internal software records.
