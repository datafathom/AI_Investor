## Overview

🎨 The Venn Diagram UI ConceptImagine the screen as a canvas where roles are "Bubbles." When you drag two Roles together, the overlapping area generates a specialized "Venn Page."1. The Trader ∩ The Guardian (The "Liquidity" Intersection)Page: Immediate Solvency. A view that shows your "Spendable Gains." How much of today’s trading profit can be moved to the bank right now without hitting margin calls?Page: Margin Safety Buffer. A visualization of your bank cash vs. your trading leverage.Page: Fast-Exit to Cash. A "Panic" button UI that closes positions and initiates an instant transfer to your checking account.2. The Strategist ∩ The Data Scientist (The "Optimization" Intersection)Page: Alpha Discovery. Where backtest results (Data) are automatically converted into executable trading rules (Strategy).Page: Variable Stress Test. A UI where you can slide "Inflation" or "Interest Rate" variables to see how it breaks your current strategy.Page: Signal Tuning. Refining the "Noise" filters on your alerts based on historical success rates.3. The Architect ∩ The Lawyer (The "Estate" Intersection)Page: Compliance Mapping. Ensuring that your long-term wealth structure (Architect) doesn't trigger "Wash Sale" rules or tax penalties (Lawyer).Page: Beneficiary Linkage. A graph view connecting specific assets (House, 401k) to specific people or entities.Page: Document Integrity. A dashboard showing which of your long-term assets are missing updated legal paperwork or titles.🛠️ Updated Role Definitions (The 6-Page Standard)I've added Marketing and The Auditor to round out the set, ensuring every persona has a deep, 6-page functional stack.📣 Marketing (The Narrative & Presentation)Responsibility: Visualizing data for external stakeholders or personal "Pitch Decks."Public Portfolio: A "Clean" view of holdings with sensitive dollar amounts hidden (percentage based).Performance Pitch: Automated slide-deck generator for your "Year in Review."Social Snapshot: One-click "Shareable" cards for specific trades or milestones.Brand Identity: Manage the "Look and Feel" of your app (Themes, Logos, Fonts).Affiliate/Referral Tracker: If the app scales, a place to track links and referrals.Milestone Celebration: A "Wall of Fame" for when you hit your Architect-defined goals.
