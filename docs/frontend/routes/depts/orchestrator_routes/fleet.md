## Overview

**From the System Philosophy:**

Orchestrator (The Command Center)
The Orchestrator is the "Executive Branch." It doesn’t do the heavy lifting; it ensures all other modules are talking to each other and provides a high-level overview of the entire financial ecosystem.

Total Homeostasis: A bird's-eye view of net worth, debt-to-income ratios, and "financial health" scores.

System Permissions: Managing API keys for brokerages, bank OAuth connections, and security protocols.

Global Notifications: Centralized alert hub for trade fills, bill due dates, and unusual volatility.

Workflow Automation: Logic that connects roles (e.g., "If Portfolio Profit > $500, move $100 to Savings Goal via Banking").
