## Overview

Sentinel status for LLM drift and fact-checking.

The **Hallucination** serves as a central hub within the Refiner department, designed to streamline core operational workflows. By integrating real-time data visualization with actionable control mechanisms, this page empowers users to monitor and intervene in critical processes effectively. Its primary objective is to reduce latency in decision-making while ensuring full visibility into the underlying state of the Refiner system. Future iterations will focus on enhancing the predictive capabilities of this interface, leveraging the Sovereign OS's neural mesh for deeper insights. Currently, it stands as a foundational component for the Refiner's strategic objectives, bridging the gap between raw data analysis and execution.
