# Total Homeostasis ⚖️

**Purpose**: Holistic overview of financial freedom and system balance.

Homeostasis is the 'Final Scoreboard'. It visualizes the balance between your total liquidity (cash/assets) and your debt/liabilities.

## Metrics
- **Liquidity vs Debt**: A high-fidelity dial showing your current financial safety.
- **Homeostatic Index**: A single number representing the overall health of your economic system.
- **Burn Rate**: Real-time tracking of expenses vs income generated by agents.
- **Goal Impact**: How current market conditions are affecting your long-term 40-year plan.

## Interpretation
If the dial is in the GREEN, the system is in growth mode. If it shifts to AMBER or RED, the 'Architect' and 'Strategist' agents will automatically suggest defensive maneuvers.
