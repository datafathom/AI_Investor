# Script: strategy_final_verify.py

## Overview
`strategy_final_verify.py` is a refined version of the Strategy verification script, focusing on post-integration visual stability.

## Core Functionality
- **High-Fidelity Check**: Specifically validates the synchronization between the backend physics engine (Physicist Agent) and the frontend strategy visualization.
