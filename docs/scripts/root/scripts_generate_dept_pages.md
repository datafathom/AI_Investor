# Script: generate_dept_pages.py

## Overview
`generate_dept_pages.py` is a boilerplate generator for React department pages.

## Core Functionality
- **Templating**: Uses a predefined template for a "modern, dark-themed department dashboard."
- **Bulk Creation**: Generates `.jsx` files in `frontend/src/pages/Departments/` for a list of department IDs, ensuring all departments have a valid, styled landing page with standard components (viz, metrics, actions).

## Status
**Essential (UI Generation)**: Used to rapidly scaffold the UI structure when new departments are added to the platform.
