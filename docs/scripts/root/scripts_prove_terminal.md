# Script: prove_terminal.py

## Overview
`prove_terminal.py` is a verification script used to prove that the terminal-based workstations are correctly integrated and accessible via the frontend.

## Core Functionality
- **Access Check**: Navigates to a specific workstation route (e.g., `/trader/monitor`) and verifies that the interactive terminal component is rendered and responsive to input.
- **Visual Proof**: Captures a screenshot specifically focused on the terminal output area.

## Status
**Essential (Verification)**: validates the complex inter-process communication required for the web-based terminal to function.
