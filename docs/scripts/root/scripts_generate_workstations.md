# Script: generate_workstations.py

## Overview
`generate_workstations.py` is a specialized generator for terminal-style "Workstation" pages within the application.

## Core Functionality
- **Registry Integration**: Reads `departmentRegistry.js` to get the list of active workstation modules.
- **Dynamic Scaffolding**: Automatically creates React components in `frontend/src/pages/workstations/` that follow the "Heavy/Industrial" UI aesthetic, including integrated terminal widgets and status panels.

## Status
**Essential (UI Generation)**: Key to maintaining the "Sovereign OS" look and feel by automating the creation of industrial-grade workstation interfaces.
