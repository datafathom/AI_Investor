# How to Enable the "Green Dot" 🟢

The Slack API confirms your bot is **ONLINE**, but Slack's app settings are hiding it. You must flip one switch to make it visible.

### 1. Open Your App Settings
Go to this link:  
👉 **[https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)**

### 2. Select Your App
Click on **"AI Investor"** (or whatever you named your bot).

### 3. Go to "App Home"
On the **Left Sidebar**, click on **App Home**.

### 4. Scroll Down to "Show Tabs"
Keep scrolling down past the "Show Tabs" section until you see:

**"Always Show Me as Online"**  
*(It might be labeled "Always Show Bot as Online")*

### 5. Turn it ON
Toggle the switch to **On**.

---

### Verification
Once this switch is **On**, the bot will immediately show a **Green Dot 🟢** in your Slack sidebar, regardless of whether the backend is running or not.

*Note: The "Disconnected" message in the channel will still work perfectly to tell you when the service stops!*
