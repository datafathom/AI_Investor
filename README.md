# AI Investor: The Autonomous Profit Engine 🐺💹

> "Equilibrium is not static; it is a violent, constant correction."

AI Investor is a **Complex Adaptive System** designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading and portfolio management. Inspired by the **Yellowstone Wolf Principle**, the system acts as a predatory stabilizer, detecting market overextension (Greed) and contraction (Fear) to maintain capital homeostasis.

## 🚀 The Vision: Beyond Simple Automation

Most trading bots are linear. AI Investor is **Non-Linear**. It perceives the market as a biological ecosystem, utilizing:

- **Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT):** To isolate dominant market frequencies.
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMM):** To classify hidden market regimes (Bull, Bear, Sideways).
- **Fear & Greed Composite Index:** A proprietary master metric fusing Google Trends, Social Sentiment, and Volatility metadata.
- **The Gap Metric:** Visualizing the mathematical distance between current state and equilibrium.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (High-Performance DNA)

- **Core Brain:** Python 3.10+ (AsyncIO, NumPy, Pandas, XGBoost, LSTM)
- **Event Bus:** Kafka (Redpanda) for sub-millisecond inter-agent communication.
- **Cognitive Map:** Neo4j Graph Database for asset-sector correlation mapping.
- **Financial Ledger:** Postgres (TimescaleDB) for high-density time-series storage.
- **Mission Control:** React 19 + Vite + D3.js + WebXR (Minority Report UX).

## 🗺️ 42-Phase Roadmap

The project is organized into a rigorous evolution plan, spanning from foundation to **Total Homeostasis**.

1. **Genesis:** Scaffolding, Kafka, and Database orchestration.
2. **The Senses:** Primary data taps, Google Trends, and Social NLP pipelines.
3. **The Intuition:** Feature engineering and Predictive Modeling.
4. **The Strategy:** Defensive Shields vs. Aggressive Alpha.
5. **Autonomy:** Self-healing observability, genetic algorithms, and auto-coding agents.

## ⚡ Quick Start

This project uses a dedicated CLI for orchestration:

```bash
# 1. Initialize environment
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Boot Infrastructure
python cli.py docker up

# 3. Verify Data Pipeline
python cli.py test-ingestion SPY
python cli.py test-crowd
```
