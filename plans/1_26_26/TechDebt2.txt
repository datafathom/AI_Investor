i also want you to comment out the taskbar widgets logic  that hover above   the performance is not there right now, i do like the start button style windows start button navigation in bottom left and the infomation and stuff in bottom right of the taskbar   but i do not want the hovering widgets and buttons at bottom... it is hurting the performance too much for now..  comment out and we will return to that later
