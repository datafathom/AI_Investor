# Stabilization Cycle G: Core System & Infrastructure

## Goal
Stabilize the Core System, Infrastructure, Security, and Reporting layers. This cycle covers the foundational services and cross-cutting concerns.

## Objectives
1.  **Audit**: Run tests for System, Security, Reporting, and Monitoring groups.
2.  **Fix**: Resolve failures, focusing on:
    - Infrastructure mocks (Cache, Kafka, Neo4j).
    - UTC datetime standardization.
    - Pydantic models for core entities.
3.  **Verify**: Ensure 100% pass rate.

## Scope

### Group G1: Infrastructure (System & Monitoring)
- `services/system/` (Cache, Logging, Tracing, Alerts)
- `tests/system/`
- `services/monitoring/`
- `tests/monitoring/`

### Group G2: Security & Business Logic (Security & Reporting)
- `services/security/` (KYC, Compliance)
- `tests/security/`
- `services/reporting/`
- `tests/reporting/`

## Strategy
1.  **Initial Audit**:
    - Run `pytest tests/system/ tests/security/ tests/reporting/ tests/monitoring/`
2.  **Analysis**:
    - `tests/system` is large (23 files). Expect mix of infrastructure and business logic errors.
    - Check for `Mock` objects not being awaited or returning invalid types.
3.  **Remediation**:
    - Prioritize `system` fixes as they are dependencies for others.
    - Standardize Pydantic v2 usage.

## Verification
- Run the full "Group G" suite.
