# Stabilization Cycle J: AI, Auth & Core Integration

## Goal
Stabilize the core "Intelligence" and "Identity" layers of the platform, along with critical integration points. This ensures the AI brain is connected, users are authenticated securely, and the graph database is functioning.

## Objectives
1.  **Audit**: Run tests for AI/ML, Auth, Neo4j, and Integration.
2.  **Fix**: Resolve failures, focusing on:
    - AI Client mocking (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini).
    - Authentication hashing and permission logic.
    - Neo4j query correctness and connection handling.
    - Integration touchpoints.
3.  **Verify**: Ensure 100% pass rate.

## Scope

### Group J1: AI & Machine Learning
- `tests/ai/` (LLM Clients)
- `tests/ai_assistant/`
- `tests/ai_predictions/`
- `tests/ml/` (Training/Deployment Pipelines)

### Group J2: Auth & Core Services
- `tests/auth/`
- `test_auth_hashing.py`
- `tests/neo4j/` (Graph DB)
- `tests/communication/` (Notifications)

### Group J3: System Integration
- `tests/integration/`

## Strategy
1.  **Initial Audit**:
    - Run `pytest tests/ai/ tests/ai_assistant/ tests/ai_predictions/ tests/ml/ tests/auth/ test_auth_hashing.py tests/neo4j/ tests/communication/ tests/integration/`
2.  **Analysis**:
    - Expect mock issues with external AI APIs.
    - Expect potential Neo4j connection errors (ensure mocking).
    - Auth hashing might be tricky if consistent salting isn't used in tests.
3.  **Remediation**:
    - Standardize LLM client mocks.
    - Ensure graph queries are syntactically correct in mocks.

## Verification
- Run the full "Group J" suite.
