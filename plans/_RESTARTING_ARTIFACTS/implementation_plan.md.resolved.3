# Stabilization Cycle C: Execution & Market Services

## Goal
Stabilize the Execution, Market, Market Data, and Trading component groups by resolving all test failures and errors. These components are critical for the real-time operation of the AI Investor platform.

## Objectives
1.  **Audit**: Run existing tests to establish a baseline of failures.
2.  **Fix**: Resolve Pydantic validation errors, mock inconsistencies, and logic bugs.
3.  **Verify**: Ensure 100% pass rate for the targeted test groups.

## Scope

### Group C1: Execution
- `services/execution/`
- `tests/execution/`

### Group C2: Market & Market Data
- `services/market/`
- `services/market_data/`
- `tests/market/`
- `tests/market_data/`

### Group C3: Trading
- `services/trading/`
- `tests/trading/`

## Strategy
1.  **Initial Audit Run**: Execute `pytest` on all four directories to capture the full failure logs.
2.  **Component-wise Repair**:
    - Start with **Execution** (likely core dependnecy).
    - Move to **Market** (data providers).
    - Finish with **Trading** (complex logic depending on others).
3.  **Common Issues**:
    - Pydantic V2 migrations.
    - Async/Sync mock mismatches.
    - Missing service dependencies (Singleton pattern).
    - `utcnow` deprecations (System-wide rule).

## Verification
- Run individual test files during fixes.
- Run the full "Group C" suite to confirm integration.
