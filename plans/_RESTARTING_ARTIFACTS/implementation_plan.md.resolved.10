# Stabilization Cycle I: Specialized Assets & Agents

## Goal
Stabilize the "Alternative" and "Agentic" layers of the platform. This cycle covers complex asset classes (Crypto, PE, VC, Real Estate, Options) and the autonomous agents managing them.

## Objectives
1.  **Audit**: Run tests for Crypto, Agents, Specialist Assets, and Options.
2.  **Fix**: Resolve failures, focusing on:
    - Web3/Blockchain mock connectivity.
    - Agent state management and orchestration.
    - Valuation logic for illiquid assets (PE/VC/Real Estate).
3.  **Verify**: Ensure 100% pass rate.

## Scope

### Group I1: Digital Assets & Agents
- `services/crypto/`
- `tests/crypto/`
- `services/agents/`
- `tests/agents/`

### Group I2: Private & Alternative Assets
- `services/real_estate/`
- `tests/real_estate/`
- `services/pe/` (Private Equity)
- `tests/pe/`
- `services/vc/` (Venture Capital)
- `tests/vc/`
- `services/alternative/`
- `tests/alternative/`

### Group I3: Derivatives
- `services/options/`
- `tests/options/`

## Strategy
1.  **Initial Audit**:
    - Run `pytest tests/crypto/ tests/agents/ tests/real_estate/ tests/pe/ tests/vc/ tests/alternative/ tests/options/`
2.  **Analysis**:
    - Expect mocked "smart contract" failures in Crypto.
    - Expect "Agent not responding" or state timeout issues in Agents.
3.  **Remediation**:
    - Standardize async definitions for Agent orchestration.
    - Ensure complex asset valuations handle 0/None gracefully.

## Verification
- Run the full "Group I" suite.
