# Stabilization Cycle F: Integration & Enterprise Services

## Goal
Stabilize the Ecosystem (Marketplace, Public API) and Enterprise (Institutional, Admin) component groups. These features enable extensibility and business-tier operations.

## Objectives
1.  **Audit**: Run tests for Marketplace, Public API, Institutional, and Enterprise groups.
2.  **Fix**: Resolve failures, focusing on:
    - Licensing and API key validation logic.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) in Enterprise/Institutional services.
    - Mock data alignment for external integrations.
3.  **Verify**: Ensure 100% pass rate.

## Scope

### Group F1: Ecosystem (Marketplace & API)
- `services/marketplace/`
- `tests/marketplace/`
- `services/public_api/`
- `tests/public_api/`

### Group F2: Enterprise (Institutional & Admin)
- `services/institutional/`
- `tests/institutional/`
- `services/enterprise/`
- `tests/enterprise/`

## Strategy
1.  **Initial Audit**:
    - Run `pytest tests/marketplace/ tests/public_api/ tests/institutional/ tests/enterprise/`
2.  **Analysis**:
    - Check for `utc` issues.
    - Verify `AsyncMock` usage for database/cache calls.
    - Check for missing schema fields (Pydantic V2).
3.  **Remediation**:
    - Fix permissions logic.
    - Ensure API key generation tests are robust.

## Verification
- Run the full "Group F" suite.
- **Result**: 21 Passed, 0 Failed. Cycle F stabilized.
