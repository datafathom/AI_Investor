# Stabilization Cycle F: Integration & Enterprise Services

## Summary
Successfully stabilized the Integration (Ecosystem) and Enterprise tiers.

### 🎯 Objectives Achieved
- [x] **Marketplace Services**: Fixed validation logic and extension management.
- [x] **Public API**: Corrected API key generation, validation, and usage tracking.
- [x] **Institutional Services**: Patched Neo4j mocks and fixed logic errors.
- [x] **Enterprise Services**: Resolved RBAC role alignment and UTC issues.

## 🛠 Fixes Implemented

### Marketplace ([marketplace_service.py](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/marketplace/marketplace_service.py))
- Added missing [get_extension_reviews](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/marketplace/marketplace_service.py#81-98) method.
- Updated `ExtensionFramework.validate_extension` to match test expectations (dict vs bool).
- Standardized `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.

### Public API ([public_api_service.py](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/public_api/public_api_service.py))
- Renamed `track_api_usage` -> [track_usage](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/public_api/public_api_service.py#105-139) in tests to match service.
- Fixed [APIKey](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/models/public_api.py#32-43) validation in tests by correctly mocking dependencies.
- Added [get_api_usage](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/public_api/public_api_service.py#140-157) method.
- Fixed [test_create_api_key_different_tiers](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/tests/public_api/test_public_api_service.py#38-53) Pydantic error.

### Institutional ([institutional_service.py](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/institutional/institutional_service.py))
- Patched `neo4j_service` to avoid live connection attempts during unit tests.
- Fixed mock data structures for client retrieval.

### Enterprise ([enterprise_service.py](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/services/enterprise/enterprise_service.py))
- Aligned [TeamRole](file:///c:/Users/astir/Desktop/AI_Company/AI_Investor/models/enterprise.py#25-31) usage in tests (`MEMBER` -> `ANALYST`) to match the model.
- Fixed UTC inconsistencies.

## ✅ Verification
All tests in the following suites are passing:
- `tests/marketplace/`
- `tests/public_api/`
- `tests/institutional/`
- `tests/enterprise/`

**Total Passing Tests in Cycle F:** 21
**Total Failures:** 0

## Next Steps
- Begin final integration review or move to next prioritized cycle if any.
