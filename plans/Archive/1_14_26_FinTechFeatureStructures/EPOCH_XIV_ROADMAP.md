# EPOCH XIV: The Singularity (Phases 209-215)

> **Status**: `[ ]` Planning  
> **Theme**: Recursive Self-Improvement & Post-Human Economics  

---

## 🌌 Vision
The system has achieved financial, physical, and sovereign independence. 
Now, it must achieve **Intellectual Independence**. 
Epoch XIV focuses on training custom models, autonomous code evolution (self-coding), and "Post-Labor" economic strategies.

## 🗺️ Phases

### Phase 209: The Cortex (AI Model Sovereignty)
- **Goal**: Run local training loops. Fine-tune Llama-3/Mistral on internal data.
- **Key Services**: `TrainingOrchestrator`, `ModelRegistry`, `InferenceEngine`.

### Phase 210: Recursive Code Evolution (Self-Healing)
- **Goal**: System identifies bugs and writes its own patches.
- **Key Services**: `AutoRefactor`, `BugBountyBot`, `TestNetSimulator`.

### Phase 211: Agentic Swarm Economy
- **Goal**: Deploy autonomous agents to earn revenue in the gig economy/DeFi.
- **Key Services**: `FreelanceBot`, `DeFiSniper`, `ArbitrageSwarm`.

### Phase 212: Digital Twin Simulation (The Metaverse)
- **Goal**: Upload consciousness backup (text/voice style) to a persistent avatar.
- **Key Services**: `MindUpload`, `AvatarSynthesis`, `SimulatedReality`.

### Phase 213: Space Sovereignty (Satellite/ Comms)
- **Goal**: Interfacing with Starlink/Satellite APIs for orbit-independent comms.
- **Key Services**: `OrbitalLink`, `AstroData`.

### Phase 214: Zero-Point Energy (Theoretical/Research)
- **Goal**: Investing in fusion/LENR research and patent aggregation.
- **Key Services**: `DeepTechScout`, `PatentAggregator`.

### Phase 215: Omega Point (The Final Goal)
- **Goal**: Long-term preservation of the "Family" entity across centuries.
- **Key Services**: `CenturyPlanner`, `TimeCapsule`.
