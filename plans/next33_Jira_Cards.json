        "description": "This phase establishes the foundational 'environmental awareness' of the Autonomous Profit Engine by integrating broader economic indicators that dictate long-term market regimes. By monitoring the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, the system transcends asset-specific analysis to perceive the 'ocean' (macro environment) rather than just the 'fish' (individual tickers). This is a critical differentiator, as it enables the system to pivot regime classifications before market liquidity evaporates during structural shifts. Successful integration of the Yield Curve and Inflation metrics provides the prerequisite context for the unified data layer in Phase 11.",

By synchronizing disparate streams—Price, Sentiment, and Macro—into a unified 1-minute bar structure, we eliminate the temporal drift that leads to erroneous algorithmic signals. The automated quarantine of 'dirty' or outlier data serves as a vital safeguard, ensuring the system never executes on corrupted inputs or misaligned timestamps. This high-fidelity dataset serves as the primary input for the Fear & Greed Composite Index in Phase 12.",

        "description": "We will now develop the proprietary master metric for market emotion, a 0–100 oscillating scale that quantifies the 'human element' of volatility. By weighting VIX, Put/Call ratios, Google Trends, and Momentum, the system creates a high-conviction emotional barometer that anticipates trend exhaustion before it is reflected in price action alone. This metric acts as the primary governor for risk appetite, determining whether the engine should lean into aggressive growth or retreat into capital preservation.

This phase constructs a pipeline that generates 200+ ML-ready vectors, with a specific emphasis on 'Sentiment Vectors' as early-warning indicators for volatility spikes. By engineering rolling window statistics and lagged features, we provide the system with the 'intuition' necessary to recognize recurring patterns within market chaos.

Achieving a 55% directional accuracy benchmark is a non-negotiable performance gate, providing the 'edge' required for sustainable alpha generation in competitive markets. By implementing model versioning and automated retraining, the engine evolves its predictive capabilities in response to structural market shifts.

By integrating Neo4j 'Recycling Centers,' we explicitly map nodes where 'dead' capital is re-routed, optimizing the flow of liquidity within our internal graph.

By enforcing strict filters such as Beta < 0.5 and Yield > 3%, the system isolates assets that provide stability during market contractions. This strategy is programmed to scale up automatically as the Fear Index rises, ensuring the 'Yellowstone' equilibrium is maintained during periods of high volatility.

We will implement 'Hysteresis' logic to prevent rapid flip-flopping during market noise, which would otherwise erode capital through transaction costs.

Strategic implementation of Wash Sale avoidance logic prevents the system from accidentally triggering disallowed tax benefits during high-frequency rotations.
