The "Assistant" Venn Interaction:
Imagine dragging The Front Office (Secretary) over The Guardian (Banking).

Intersection Result: "The Dispute Center." A UI where you see a list of every bank fee. You click one button, and the Voice Advocate Agent initiates a phone call to the bank to ask for a "Courtesy Refund," while the Inbox Gatekeeper watches for the confirmation email.

Total Organization Structure:
Total Roles: 14

Total Agents: 84

Backend Nodes: Neo4j (Relationships), Postgres (Ledger), Kafka (Messaging).


This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines how your 14 Departments and 84 AI Agents synchronize for a Quarterly Business Review (QBR). In a 1-person shop, the goal of the QBR is to ensure the "Human CEO" (you) is still aligned with the "Autonomous Engine."

📅 SOP: The Quarterly Financial Alignment (QFA)
Objective: To audit the previous 90 days, re-calibrate long-term goals, and optimize the AI workforce for the next quarter.

Phase 1: The Forensic Audit (Days 1–2)
Primary Teams: Auditor, Lawyer, Sentry

Data Integrity Check: The Reconciliation Bot (Auditor) cross-references every Kafka-streamed transaction against the Postgres ledger and bank APIs to ensure the "Graph" is 100% accurate.

Security Sweep: The Permission Auditor (Sentry) reviews every AI Agent’s access level. If the "Trader" doesn't need "Steward" data, its permissions are tightened.

Tax Shield Update: The Tax-Loss Harvester (Lawyer) calculates "Year-to-Date" liability and identifies any "dead weight" in the portfolio that should be sold to offset gains before the quarter closes.

Phase 2: Performance Evaluation (Days 3–4)
Primary Teams: Data Scientist, HR, Physicist

Agent Performance Review: The Performance Reviewer (HR) generates a report card for all agents.

Example: If the Sniper (Trader) had high slippage, it is flagged for "retraining" or its execution logic is swapped.

Edge Analysis: The Edge-Decay Monitor (Data Scientist) checks if your "Iron Condor" strategies are still statistically viable in the current volatility regime.

Psychological Audit: The Behavioral Analyst (Auditor) identifies if the user made "Emotional Trades" during the quarter and updates the Internal Policy Maker (HR) to create new "Hard Blocks" for the next quarter.

Phase 3: Structural Re-Alignment (Days 5–6)
Primary Teams: Architect, Strategist, Hunter

Goal Mapping: The Life-Cycle Modeler (Architect) updates the retirement/home-buy timeline based on the quarter's actual P&L.

Asset Location Tuning: The Tax-Location Optimizer (Architect) suggests moving assets between taxable and non-taxable accounts to reduce "Tax Drag."

Moonshot Review: The Exit Strategy Modeler (Hunter) reviews any venture/crypto "Moonshots" that hit their targets and triggers a "Profit Take" signal to move funds into the Guardian’s safety buckets.

Phase 4: The Executive Synthesis (Day 7)
Primary Teams: Orchestrator, Front Office, Envoy

The Quarterly Briefing: The Synthesizer (Orchestrator) assembles a high-level visual dashboard.

External Reporting: The Pitch Deck Generator (Envoy) creates a "Net Worth Growth" PDF.

Logistics Execution: The Logistics Researcher (Front Office) sees a "Quarterly Bonus" has been cleared by the Compensation Specialist (HR) and automatically suggests 3 vacation itineraries within that specific budget.

🛠️ The "Executive Action" Output
At the end of this SOP, the system presents you with Three Primary Buttons:

"Commit Changes": Automatically rebalances portfolios, pays quarterly estimated taxes, and updates AI logic.

"Dispute & Negotiate": Sends the Voice Advocate (Front Office) to call creditors/banks for any flagged fees found during the audit.

"Update Blueprint": Opens the Architect role to physically move your long-term "Life Goals" on the timeline.

------END OF TABLE---------------------

To scale a 1-person shop into a 14-department powerhouse, you need a standardized way to "plug in" new intelligences without breaking your Neo4j graph or Kafka pipelines.

This New Agent Onboarding Template ensures that every new bit of functionality has a clear purpose, a defined "boss" (the Department), and a predictable data flow.

🛠️ New Agent Onboarding Template (SOP-085)
When you identify a new financial need (e.g., "I want to track the price of Lithium for my EV stock trades"), use this template to define the Agent before writing a single line of code.

1. Identity & Department
Agent Name: (e.g., The Commodity Sentinel)

Department (Role): (e.g., Data Scientist / The Hunter)

Primary Objective: (e.g., Monitor raw material costs to predict manufacturer margin compression.)

2. Data Contract (The Inputs)
Kafka Topics to Watch: (e.g., market.commodities.live, news.rss.industrial)

Postgres Tables to Query: (e.g., user_holdings, sector_benchmarks)

Neo4j Nodes to Watch: (e.g., :Ticker {sector: 'EV'}, :Supplier)

3. Operational Logic (The Chain)
Step 1 (Ingestion): Normalize raw data into standard units.

Step 2 (Analysis): Compare current price to 52-week moving average.

Step 3 (Cross-Reference): Check which portfolio holdings have a "Depends On" relationship in the Graph to this commodity.

4. Egress & Output (The Results)
UI Component: (e.g., Toast notification, Heatmap update, or New Node creation).

Downstream Agent Trigger: (e.g., "Alert The Strategist to adjust the Stop-Loss for Tesla.")

Ledger Impact: (e.g., "Log entry in system_alerts table.")

🚀 Final Summary of Your Organizational Architecture
By following this deep-dive, you have moved from a simple "App" to a Sovereign Financial Entity.

14 Departments: Each with a unique GUI Persona and cognitive focus.

84+ Specialized Agents: Each with a 6-step functional chain.

The "Venn" UI Logic: A method for merging departments to solve complex, overlapping problems (like Liquidity vs. Execution).

The SOP Framework: A way to make sure the "Human CEO" stays in control without being overwhelmed by the data.
