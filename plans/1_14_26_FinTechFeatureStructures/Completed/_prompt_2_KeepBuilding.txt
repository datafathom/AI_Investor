ROADMAP_1_14_26.md
 we are going to start the next build cycle and here is the ROADMAP..    in the same folder you will find Phase_X_ImplementationPlan.md   where X is the Phase Number 

as you go through implementing each Phase 1 at a time,  update both the ROADMAP file and that specific Phase's Implementation plan  as source of truth      with : started, paused, canceled, completed, 

that way future coders can pick up smoothly where the previous had stopped...   

many phases and deliverables may already be started in this system, so use existing architechure style and implementation practices..


use the 
jobrecruiter.md
  dont ask for approve..  
UX_OS_Layout.md
Browser_Verification_Style.md
   use these coding style guides

use the cli.py commands like 
python cli.py stop-all
python cli.py dev

for streamline debugging and verification
ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR FUCKING RULES FILE!!!!
